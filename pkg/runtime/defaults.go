// defaultEventChannelCapacity is the buffer size used for every Event
// channel the runtime hands back to a caller. Sized large enough that a
// reasonable producer (the run loop, a stream forwarder) can stay ahead of
// a typical consumer (the TUI, an API server) without blocking, but small
// enough to keep memory pressure bounded when consumers are slow.
//
// All event-channel constructors in pkg/runtime go through this constant
// so the buffer size is set in exactly one place.
const defaultEventChannelCapacity = 128

// defaultMaxOverflowCompactions caps the number of consecutive
// context-overflow auto-compactions that the run loop will attempt before
// giving up and surfacing the error to the caller. The runtime's
// compaction routine cannot guarantee that the resulting transcript will
// fit inside the model's context window (very large recent messages may
// still exceed it), so this bound prevents an infinite retry loop.
//
// Production uses 1 (one compaction attempt per stream); tests can change
// this via WithMaxOverflowCompactions to verify both the "compaction
// succeeded" and "compaction exhausted" branches without having to drive
// many real overflows.
const defaultMaxOverflowCompactions = 1

// toolsChangedTimeout bounds how long a single MCP-tool-change refresh
// may take. The handler is invoked outside any RunStream goroutine (it's
// a notification from a server), so a slow or stuck server cannot be
// allowed to wedge the caller indefinitely.
const toolsChangedTimeout = 5 * time.Second

// defaultToolListTimeout bounds how long EmitStartupInfo waits for a single
// toolset to enumerate its tools while populating the sidebar. A toolset
// whose Tools() blocks indefinitely — e.g. an MCP stdio subprocess that
// never answers tools/list, possibly while also ignoring context
// cancellation — would otherwise stall the whole startup: the terminal
// ToolsetInfo{Loading:false} event is never emitted, so the sidebar stays
// on "Loading tools…" forever and /quit appears to hang. A timed-out
// toolset is skipped here; it stays usable for the actual agent turn, which
// lists its tools again without this startup bound. Tests override it via
// WithToolListTimeout to exercise the skip path without a real-time wait.
const defaultToolListTimeout = 10 * time.Second

// defaultToolStartTimeout bounds how long EmitStartupInfo waits for a single
// toolset to start while populating the sidebar. A toolset whose Start()
// blocks indefinitely — e.g. an MCP stdio server backed by a wedged Docker
// daemon that never finishes launching the container — would otherwise stall
// the loop the same way a hung Tools() does: the terminal
// ToolsetInfo{Loading:false} event is never emitted and the sidebar animates
// "tools available…" forever. A timed-out toolset is skipped for this startup
// pass only; the run loop retries Start on the first user message. It is
// longer than defaultToolListTimeout because a cold start can legitimately
// include an image pull. Tests override it via WithToolStartTimeout.
const defaultToolStartTimeout = 30 * time.Second
